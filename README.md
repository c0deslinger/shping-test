## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or VS Code
- Valid API keys for:
  - Unsplash
  - Pixabay

### Configuration

The application uses environment-specific configuration files located in `project/config/`:

- API endpoints configuration
- API keys for Unsplash and Pixabay
- Environment-specific variables

### Running the Application

#### Method 1: Using VS Code

1. Create or update `.vscode/launch.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Development",
                "request": "launch",
                "type": "dart",
                "program": "lib/main_dev.dart",
                "args": [
                    "--flavor",
                    "Dev"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Production",
                "request": "launch",
                "type": "dart",
                "flutterMode": "release",
                "program": "lib/main_prod.dart",
                "args": [
                    "--flavor",
                    "Prod"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

2. Launch the app using `F5` or `Fn + F5`

#### Method 2: Using Command Line

##### Build App Bundle

```bash
# Production
flutter build appbundle --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart

# Development
flutter build appbundle --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart
```

##### Build APK

```bash
# Production
flutter build apk --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart

# Development
flutter build apk --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart
```

## Localization

### Adding New Languages

1. Create a new JSON file in `assets/translations/`
2. Name the file using the appropriate language code (e.g., `en.json`, `id.json`)
3. Add the language code to the supported languages list in `main_common.dart`

Example translation file structure:

```json
{
    "key": "translated_value"
}
```

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

The photo repository tests are available in the test directory.
